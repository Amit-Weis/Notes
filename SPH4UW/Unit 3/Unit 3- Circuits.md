## V = RI
- this is the foundation of the circuit analysis
- we can use it for the total circuit but also specific elements in the circuit
- the resistance of a circuit with multiple resistors is just the same of all of the resistances
- $R_{eq} = R_{1}+R_{2}$ 
- for parrelel circuits, the current will split over the load. if there are 2 paths in parrellel, each one will have half the current
- for parrelel circuits:
- $\frac{1}{R_{eq}}= \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{1}}$
- voltage remains the same across the circuit in both parrelel and series circuits

## Electric Current and DC circuits 
### Current
- the rate of charge flow, $I$
- SI unit is $\frac{C}{S}$ or $A$
- current is **not** the speed, its the amount of charge
- conventional current is + $\to$ -, but in reality - $\to$ + 
- flow of water is quite analgous to the flow of electric current
- voltage is bassicly water pressure, but for elceitircity
- batteries are a source of constant voltage, which is why they are used
- battery bassicly acts as a source of a wave, which then loses energy and ehight when it hits electrical compononets or resisitors, then when it evneutally rereachess the battery, its at 0 energy, and therefore there is a $\Delta V$
- the average direction follows flow, the electrons in reality bounce around a lot 
- energy flows through the path of least resisitnac
- ammeters
	- measure the current going throug  the ammeter
	- only works in series
	- very little close to 0 resistance 
	- will blow up in parrelele circuits due to fuck all
### conductors
- some conductors conduct better, because they have less conductors
- rasihing the resisitance in a curuitc reduceds the current, however this relahisnship is linear in ohmic mateirles, if the realshinship is not linear, it is a non ohmic matierla
- you want things to be ohmic because it makes predciting thier behaivbour much easier
- every conductor conducts eletric charge based on its resistiance
- each mateiraly has a different resistivity
- resistivity is abbrevieated using the greek letter $\rho$ 
- we can also fine
$$
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
$$
- we want as low as resitivity as possilbe 
- silver is the best conductor, but it tarnishes/rusts so its bad
- copper or gold is very good, copper is very cheap and very malleable, but gold is very untarnishble 
- resistance $\neq$ resistivity
