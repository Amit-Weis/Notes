# Magnetic Field (did not pay attention yo)
- magnets were dsicorved by the chinise and the greeks 
- the name was cointed by the greeks 
- unlike eltrci effects due to the rubbing of various usbtances these magnets would come out of the ground already reppling and attracting objects
- always being able to tell which dierction was north ushered in the age of explioration 
- oppiste pols attract and similar pols repel 
- if you cut a magnet in half, it will creat 2 "nono" pols and form a new smaller magnet
- ferromagnetic, these materials can be permantently magnetiszed by the application of a field 
- paramagnetnic, these materils weakly interact with the external field and temporariklyu lines up some of thier domains, and then they can attach to another magnet, but not become thier own magnentic
- diamagnetic, same as paramagnetni but repell (the poles will flip to make sure it repels)
