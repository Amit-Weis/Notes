# Lesson 1
- something existes4d that was pretty small 
- cathode ray tubes, search up shit
- material of cathode rays does not matter, its just the charge 
- 

were doing it ourselves
we want to establish a equation between $ft^2$ and $m^2$ but we only have for $m$ and $ft$ which are _not_ squared 
cuz $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2$
if u dont have units, $1 \neq 3.28$, but $1m = 3.28 ft$ 


$$
\begin{gather}
1 m = 3.281 ft \\
1m^2 = 3.281^2 ft^2 \\
1m^2 = 10.7 ft^2 \\
21.5 ft^2 = 
\end{gather}
$$
