# Lesson one - mechmanical waves

- A wave travels along its meduim, and transports energy
- longitudinal waves are when the ossicaltion goes in the same direction as the displacement of matierla particles 
- transverse waves is when the ossicaltion is perpincudlare to the displacemnt of matieral particles
- some waves exhibit both properties
- the vleocity of a wave can be expressed by its wavelength / period or its wavelength * freceunecy ($v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$ or $v = \lambda f$)
- the speed a wave travels through a meduim is $v_{string} = \sqrt{ \frac{F_{t}}{\frac{m}{l}} }$
