## V = RI
- this is the foundation of the circuit analysis
- we can use it for the total circuit but also specific elements in the circuit
- the resistance of a circuit with multiple resistors is just the same of all of the resistances
- $R_{eq} = R_{1}+R_{2}$ 
- for parrelel circuits, the current will split over the load. if there are 2 paths in parrellel, each one will have half the current
- for parrelel circuits:
- $\frac{1}{R_{eq}}= \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{1}}$
- voltage remains the same across the circuit in both parrelel and series circuits
