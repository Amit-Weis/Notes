# ATP & Energy

- Metabolism is the process the body undergoes to convert food into energy to do work
- recall:
	- First law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy
	- Second law of thermodynamics, systems tend towards a state of disorder
	- Entropy
	- Exergonic/endergonic
- organelles may start to get old and not function well 
	- thus creating disorder in the cell
- the cell needs to "clean up" waste inside the cell, using lysosomes
	- thus creating order in the cell
- in biological systems it is difficult to measure the entropy, because the bond breaking/forming is not as clear-cut as most reactions are very complicated mechanisms
- when there is bond breaking, there is always bond forming, and vice versa
- metabolism reactions often have very high heat release, which needs to be accounted for in some manner
	- manners include:
		- using energy as waste and staving it off via sweating
		- using energy as a product for another reaction 
		- breaks down mechanism to a lot of little steps to make the releases in energy 
- organisms are endergonic systems, we need a lot of energy
- exergonic reactions fuel all the endergonic reactions in the body
	- IE: eating to build muscles
	- this is called energy coupling
- the energy 'currency' of our cells is called ATP
	- Adenosine Triphosphate
	- similar to nucleotides and is a nucliec acid
	- good for short term energy usage (not for storage)

- ATP can be "hydrolyzed" and lose one of its phosphate and forms ADP and releases energy. the phosphate then bonds to another molecule to give it energy
- then you can add another phosphate to ADP to form another ATP
- when a phosphate is transferred to another molecule the other molecule is called phosphorylated
