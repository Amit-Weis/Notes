# ATP & Energy
---
- Metabolism is the process the body undergoes to convert food into energy to do work
- recall:
	- First law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy
	- Second law of thermodynamics, systems tend towards a state of disorder
	- Entropy
	- Exergonic/endergonic
- organelles may start to get old and not function well 
	- thus creating disorder in the cell
- the cell needs to "clean up" waste inside the cell, using lysosomes
	- thus creating order in the cell
- in biological systems it is difficult to measure the entropy, because the bond breaking/forming is not as clear-cut as most reactions are very complicated mechanisms
- when there is bond breaking, there is always bond forming, and vice versa
- metabolism reactions often have very high heat release, which needs to be accounted for in some manner
	- manners include:
		- using energy as waste and saving it off via sweating
		- using energy as a product for another reaction 
		- breaks down mechanism to a lot of little steps to make the releases in energy 
- organisms are endergonic systems, we need a lot of energy
- exergonic reactions fuel all the endergonic reactions in the body
	- IE: eating to build muscles
	- this is called energy coupling
- the energy 'currency' of our cells is called ATP
	- Adenosine Triphosphate
	- similar to nucleotides and is a nucleic acid
	- good for short term energy usage (not for storage)
	- ![](../images/atp%20diagram.png)
- ATP can be "hydrolyzed" and lose one of its phosphate and forms ADP and releases energy. the phosphate then bonds to another molecule to give it energy
- then you can add another phosphate to ADP to form another ATP
- when a phosphate is transferred to another molecule the other molecule is called phosphorylated 
# Cellular Respiration Overview
---
- purpose of cellular respiration is to convert energy trapped within glucose to energy trapped within ATP, which can do work in the cell much more easy
- see above for ATP and ADP info
- recall REDOX
	- oxidation releases electron, reduction gains electron
	- if something lost an electron, something must gain an electron
	- electrons will be passed along with the following loops like so:
		- ![](../images/electronchain.png)
- Hydrogen Acceptors
	- Coenzymes, they help reactions involving enzymes
	- $NAD^+$ or $FAD^+$ are coenzymes in an oxidized form
	- $NADH$ or $FADH$ are coenzymes in a reduced form
	- energy carriers 
- one cycle of cellular respiration will produce 38 moles of ATP, with a majority being from the electron transport system 
- in eukaryotic cells, stage 1 occurs in the cytosol. the rest of the stages occur in the mitochondrion 
- structure of the mitochondrion:
	- ![](../images/powerhouseofcellstructure.png)
	- Matrix, tons of enzymes molecules, neutrons etc are floating in there, this is where electron transport happens. the folds in the matrix (cristae) increase the surface area
	- inner membrane, tons of enzyme complexes which produce atp (called stalked particles)

# Glycolysis
---
- the goal of cellular respiration is to capture free energy in glucose to form ATP
- in order to achieve this two methods are used:
	- substrate level phosphorylation
	- oxidative phosphorylation
- Substrate level phosphorylation
	- ATP is formed directly from the enzyme controlled reactions (in glycolysis and krebs cycle)
	- occurs when a phosphate group is transferred from one molecule to an ADP molecule
-  oxidative phosphorylation
	- ATP is formed indirectly via multiple different steps in the electron transport chain 
	- formed via a series of redox reactions
- pyruvate will undergo krebs cycle and ETC only if $O_2$ is present 
- Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol/cytoplasm
- glycolysis converts glucose into 2 pyruvate ($C_{3}H_3O_3^-$)
- glycolysis is an anaerobic process
- glycolysis requires ATP to start, is referred to the energy input stage to get the rest of the cycle going 
- when atp is generated in glycolysis its called substrate level phosphorylation 

# Link Reaction / Pyruvate Oxidation
- What happens after glycolysis
	- if $O_2$ is present, the hydrogen acceptors ($NADH$ and $FADH_2$) enter the mitochondria for krebs cycle (aerobic respiration)
	- if no $O_2$ is present, you go into anaerobic respiration and the pyruvate stays in the cytoplasm where its converted to lactic acid in animals or ethanol in plants (fermentation)
- when $CO_2$ is lost in a reaction its called decarboxylation
	- (first step of krebs cycle)
- COenzyme-A is a carrier which will hold and modify molecules (it's a derivative of vitamin B which is why i need it)
	- all it does is move acetyl to krebs cycle, then move back to wait for more acetyl

# Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle)
- occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion
- every step is enzyme driven
- oxaloacetate is the reactant and product, while all the rest are just a reactant and product
1. According to Model 2, what happens to pyruvic acid during the Krebs cycle?
	1. 
2. According to Model 2, where does the change identified in the previous question occur?
	1. 
3. Count the number of atoms of carbon in pyruvic acid and explain why three molecules of carbon dioxide are produced.
	1. There are 3 carbons in Pyruvate, and 3 carbon dioxide released
4. Considering that glycolysis produces two pyruvic acid molecules per glucose molecule, how many total CO2 molecules will be produced from the complete breakdown of each glucose molecule? Show a mathematical equation to support your answer.
	1. $2 \text{ pyruvate} = 6CO_{2}=C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$
5. What two hydrogen-carrying molecules are formed during the Krebs cycle?
	1. $NADH$ and $FADH_2$
