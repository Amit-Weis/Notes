| Fredrich Meischer - Pus guy                  | discovery of nuclein in 1868                                               | - wanted to figure out what was inside the nucleus of cells<br>- found there is a phosphorous-containing substance, named it nuclein<br>- he scraped pus out of surgical bandages to figure out what was in there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| Joachim Hammerling                           | discoverd that nucleus contains information for traits and controls growth | - found algae, noticed that the nucleus is in the base of the plant<br>- if you cut off the top of the algae, it will regrow<br>- if you cut off the bottom of the algae, it will not regrow<br>- therefore something in the base (the nucleus) controls the growth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

| Avery, MacLeod, McCarty - mini mouse killers | Figured out transformation does not occur when there is no DNA             | - which part of the cell changed the harmless bacteria into harmful bacteria <br>- take a solution of heat killed unsafe bacteria, split the sample into 3<br>- in one solution, add a protein enzyme to remove protein, a RNA enzyme, and a DNA enzyme<br>- add in the safe bacteria, notice that transformation does not occur when there is no DNA, therefore the DNA is what causes transformation to occur<br>- the material being picked up by the bacteria was DNA                                                               |     |

# people that did shit 2 (less boring)
- DNA = LIFE
- 1953, Watson and Crick, Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, figured out that DNA is a helix, made of nitrogenous bases. the DNA is made up of these 4 bases, which code for all of life 
- how does daughter cells have the exact same DNA sequence, how does DNA replicate 
- understanding DNA replication i s the basis of understanding life and genetics
- 3 theories 
	- conservative replication, get copied and make a completely new one 
	- dispersive, first the DNA is cut, then copied, then reattached 
	- semi-conservative, the DNA would separate, then each strand would be copied (most skeptical)
- Matthew Meleson, and Franklin Stahl, made the most beautiful experiment in biology 
- used bacteria to answer the question of DNA replication
- they grew the cells in the presence of nitrogen that is especially heavy, $N_{15}$, then they moved the bacteria to some lighter nitrogen.
- they then centrifuged the DNA, seeing that all the dna is in one band (good)
- they let the bacteria split in the lighter nitrogen, they saw that all of the DNA is now in the middle of the beaker 
- then again, now the centrifuged solution had two bands
- image diagram
	- ![](../images/dna%20replication.png)
- DNA runs anti-parallel to each other, 5 is the end with the phosphate, 3 is the end with the hydroxide, so a strand runs 5 to 3 or 3 to 5 depending on your perspective
- the enzyme responsible for unzipping the double helix is called $\text{DNA Helicase}$ 
	- it breaks the hydrogen bonds between the bases 
	- also depisotes something called $\text{Single Stranded Binding Protiens}$, which prevent the hydrogen bonds from reattaching. 
	- this new unzipped formation is called the replication fork 
- $\text{DNA Gyrase}$ or $\text{DNA topisomerase}$ (same thing diff name) will make little cuts just infront of the helicase, to unwind the dna, and let the dna unzip in a flat formation
- note that this happens in multiple points in the dna at once
	- ![](../images/dna%20replciation%20bulslhit.png)
- nucleotides are added by $\text{DNA polymerases 3}$ 
	- polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3 end of the dna (the hydroxide group)
	- the new strands will always be assembled in the 5 to 3 direction, because off this restriction
- $\text{DNA primase}$ is an enzyme that lays down $RNA$ $Primers$ 
- $Rna$ $Primers$ act as starting points to assist DNA polymerase in building new strands 
- $primase$ is following the $helicase$, meaning that the unzipping is happening in the same direction as the new building 
	- due to one of the strands being significnatly slower, because its being built in the oppiste direction, its called the lagging strand
	- the chunks of the lagging strands built in, are called in Okazaki fragments 
	- the lagging strand is made discontinuously
	- Lagging strand vs leading strand
		- ![](../images/dna%20is%20being%20replicated%20i%20think.png)
- $DNA$ $Pol$ $1$ removes the $primers$ and replaces them with DNA
- $DNA$ $Ligase$ then joins the gaps in the sugar backbone
- note that a strand is bothing leading and lagging at the same time 
	- ![](../images/stupid%20ullshit.png)
- both $Polymerase$ 1 and 3 proofread the complemntary strands, and remove incorreclty paried nucleotides and replace them with the correct ones 
- Exonucleases ($polymerase$) are enzymes that work by cleaving nucleotides one at a time from the end
- $deoxyribonucleoside$ $triphosphates$ is just a nucleotide with an ATP attached, and once the ATP is turned into ADP to form energy,
