| Fredrich Meischer - Pus guy                  | discovery of nuclein in 1868                                               | - wanted to figure out what was inside the nucleus of cells<br>- found there is a phosphorous-containing substance, named it nuclein<br>- he scraped pus out of surgical bandages to figure out what was in there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| Joachim Hammerling                           | discoverd that nucleus contains information for traits and controls growth | - found algae, noticed that the nucleus is in the base of the plant<br>- if you cut off the top of the algae, it will regrow<br>- if you cut off the bottom of the algae, it will not regrow<br>- therefore something in the base (the nucleus) controls the growth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| Fredrick Griffith - the mouse killer         | figured out bacteria can transform                                         | - took some safe bacteria, and injected it into a mouse, mouse lived<br>- took a not safe bacteria, and injected it into a mouse, mouse died<br>- took the not safe bacteria, and superheated it untill they died, injected it into a mouse, mouse lived<br>- took the heat killed safe, and the other safe bacteria, and injected it into the mouse, the mouse for some reason died<br>- therefore found bacteria could take up genetic info from its environment, and turn safe strains into not safe deadly strains (transformation) |     |
| Avery, MacLeod, McCarty - mini mouse killers | Figured out transformation does not occur when there is no DNA             | - which part of the cell changed the harmless bacteria into harmful bacteria <br>- take a solution of heat killed unsafe bacteria, split the sample into 3<br>- in one solution, add a protein enzyme to remove protein, a RNA enzyme, and a DNA enzyme<br>- add in the safe bacteria, notice that transformation does not occur when there is no DNA, therefore the DNA is what causes transformation to occur<br>- the material being picked up by the bacteria was DNA                                                               |     |
| chargaff - base pairs guy                    | A $\to$ T and G $\to$ C                                                    | - no details ig fuck you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |
| Hershey & chase - The Phage people           | confirmed the mini mouse killers experiment                                | - bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria<br>- only made of 2 things, DNA and protein<br>- look like robots :)<br>- Radioactively tagged the $P$ (DNA) and the $S$ (Protein) in the solution <br>- infected some bacteria, didn't find any radioactive sulfur left in cells <br>- infected some bacteria did find radioactive phosphorus inside the cells<br>- therefore the bacteriophages infect bacteria via DNA, since that's the only thing that contains the Phosphorus<br>                                                  |     |
