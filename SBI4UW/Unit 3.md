- all of this combines into the current model 
	- base pairs 

# people that did shit 2 (less boring)
- DNA = LIFE
- 1953, Watson and Crick, Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, figured out that DNA is a helix, made of nitrogenous bases. the DNA is made up of these 4 bases, which code for all of life 
- how does daughter cells have the exact same DNA sequence, how does DNA replicate 
- understanding DNA replication i s the basis of understanding life and genetics
- 3 theories 
	- conservative replication, get copied and make a completely new one 
	- dispersive, first the DNA is cut, then copied, then reattached 
	- semi-conservative, the DNA would separate, then each strand would be copied (most skeptical)
- Matthew Meleson, and Franklin Stahl, made the most beautiful experiment in biology 
- used bacteria to answer the question of DNA replication
- they grew the cells in the presence of nitrogen that is especially heavy, $N_{15}$, then they moved the bacteria to some lighter nitrogen.
- they then centrifuged the DNA, seeing that all the dna is in one band (good)
- they let the bacteria split in the lighter nitrogen, they saw that all of the DNA is now in the middle of the beaker 
- then again, now the centrifuged solution had two bands
- image diagram
	- ![](../images/dna%20replication.png)
- DNA runs anti-parallel to each other, 5 is the end with the phosphate, 3 is the end with the hydroxide, so a strand runs 5 to 3 or 3 to 5 depending on your perspective
- the enzyme responsible for unzipping the double helix is called $\text{DNA Helicase}$ 
	- it breaks the hydrogen bonds between the bases 
	- also depisotes something called $\text{Single Stranded Binding Protiens}$, which prevent the hydrogen bonds from reattaching. 
	- this new unzipped formation is called the replication fork 
- $\text{DNA Gyrase}$ or $\text{DNA topisomerase}$ (same thing diff name) will make little cuts just infront of the helicase, to unwind the dna, and let the dna unzip in a flat formation
- note that this happens in multiple points in the dna at once
	- ![](../images/dna%20replciation%20bulslhit.png)
- nucleotides are added by $\text{DNA polymerases 3}$ 
	- polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3 end of the dna (the hydroxide group)
	- the new strands will always be assembled in the 5 to 3 direction, because off this restriction
- $\text{DNA primase}$ is an enzyme that lays down $RNA$ $Primers$ 
- $Rna$ $Primers$ act as starting points to assist DNA polymerase in building new strands 
- $primase$ is following the $helicase$, meaning that the unzipping is happening in the same direction as the new building 
	- due to one of the strands being significnatly slower, because its being built in the oppiste direction, its called the lagging strand
	- the chunks of the lagging strands built in, are called in Okazaki fragments 
	- the lagging strand is made discontinuously
	- Lagging strand vs leading strand
		- ![](../images/dna%20is%20being%20replicated%20i%20think.png)
- $DNA$ $Pol$ $1$ removes the $primers$ and replaces them with DNA
- $DNA$ $Ligase$ then joins the gaps in the sugar backbone
- note that a strand is bothing leading and lagging at the same time 
	- ![](../images/stupid%20ullshit.png)
- both $Polymerase$ 1 and 3 proofread the complemntary strands, and remove incorreclty paried nucleotides and replace them with the correct ones 
- Exonucleases ($polymerase$) are enzymes that work by cleaving nucleotides one at a time from the end
- $deoxyribonucleoside$ $triphosphates$ is just a nucleotide with an ATP attached, and once the ATP is turned into ADP to form energy, 

# Protein Synthesis (Translation)
- DNA getes transcribed into mRNA, which then gets translated into a polypeptide
- codons: 3 bases on an mRNA that codes for a specific amino acid
- the ribosome will go down the 5 to 3 direction untill it finds the AUG codon for methionine, and then it will stop building the polypeptide when it finds a UAG, UAA, UGA stop codon
- ribosome is made of two pipeces, smaller unit on bottom larger unit on top 
- tRNA, which is a amino acid with a RNA cap that is an anti codon
- the ribosome has a large collection of tRNA's which it uses to match to the coding rna to build the polypeptide chain 
- process
	- mRNA exits the nuclease after transcription 
	- the cap gets attached to the ribosome small subunit, which starts the reading process
	- once a AUG codon is found, the large subunit binds to the whole palce, and the first trna is in the p site, with a second tRNA entering the a site
	- the amino acid is then moved from the p site tRNA to the a site tRNA 
	- then the a site tRNA moves to the psite and the mRNA gets moved and a new tRNA enters the a site
	- once a stop codon is found, a release factor is put into the a site, which then dissacoiated the whole system and the new polypeptide is released
- translation initaition complex is 
	- both pecies of the ribosome 
	- the tRNA with met 
	- mRNA 
- all must be present for translation to begin

# Bacteria are fuck ugly yo
- gene regulation in prokaryotes
- prokaryotic cells dont have a nuclues 
- humans have bacteria in your stomach 
- this bactera is called E. Coli 
- the E. Coli will consume whatever you eat 
- we do not always need all protiens at all times 
- our genes have ways of communicating whether we need a gene to be transcribed and translated
- the lac operon in bacteria controls the enzyme that breaks down lactose (prokaryotes only)
- Operons are the following:

# This is on the test fuck face
- mutations 
	- changes in DNA sequence 
	- can only be inherited if they occur in the gametes (eggs and sperm)
	- mutations cannot be inherteid if they are in the somatic cells
- point mutations, insertions and deletions 
	- occaisonly during replication, a missmatched base pair will go unnotticed, the daubter cells will try to correct it , but there is no way to know which base pair is the corrrect one. So therefore there is a 50% chance that it will correct wrongly
	- the strands often break and a enzyme will fill in nucleotdies, which then increase the length of one of the strands . dna replication wlil replicate one pair of correct dna and one pair of elongated dna 
- three types of substitution (point) mutations, 
	- silent mutation
		- the amino acid is not changed even though the codon is changed
		- this is due several codons code for the same thing, so sometimes a mutation wil cause no change
	- missense mutation 
		- the change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid 
		- usally the protien still works but worse
		- example, sickle cell anaemia is a missesnse mutation 
	- Nonsesnse mutation 
		- the codon is changed now codes for a stop codon 
		- this bassicly kills the protien 
		- the body can usally recognize this, and the short protien gets eaten by proteases
- insertion mutation 
	- one or more base pairs is added to the DNA sequence 
	- the body is really bad at recongize these 
- deletion mutation 
	- one or more base pairs is taken out 
	- cause problems 
	- body is also bad at recognizing these 
- Frameshift mutations 
	- deletion of base pairs not in multiples of 3 (1 or 2), will cause the chain after to shift the whole dna strand
	- this will change every single codon (the T of THE is removed)
		- ![](../images/codon%20changing%20heheh.png)
- Other mutations can occur on the chromosomes during mitosis or meiosis
- 4 types of chromosomal mutations 
	- deletion, loss of a part of a chromosome
	- duplication, extra copy made of part of chromosome
	- inversion, reverses direction of part of chromosome 
	- translocation, part of one attaches to another chromosomes
	- image visual
		- ![](../images/chromosome%20bullshit%20i%20think.png)
- causes of mutation 
	- spontanous mutations, dna failing to copuyu
	- mutagenic agents (chemicals or radation or wtv


# genetric shit combiniantoin
- using tools and gene tech to modify living organisms 
- examples:
	- production of insulin 
	- pesticide and pest resistant crops 
	- antifreeze from fish blood into strawberries
- geneteic engineering i sthe alteration of a genome by subsittuting / iontroducing new genetic material intentionally
- bacteria are often used because
	- they are prokaryotes 
	- they replicate easily 
	- populations grow really fast 
	- have a single chromosome (and no histones \[ which just means that the chromosome is naked] )
	- have plasmids 
		- very small circles of DNA present in bacteria
		- can replicate on thier own
		- carry extra genese 
		- be able to use heavy metals or other things 
- transformation 
	- bacteria can pick up peices of DNA from thier enviorment & other bacteria 
	- incorporate bits of dna into their own genome 
	- this change can make new features occur 
	- makes bacteria evolve rapidly 
- transduction 
	- a virus (bacteriophages) inefcts bacteria, then inserts a peice of dna into the bcateria's genome 
- conjugation 
	- sexual reproduction via a pilis
	- exchanging plasmids with each other 
- plasmids used for transferring foreign genetic material into a cell are called vectors 
- how do we know that the gene has actually been combined?
	- usallly insert a marker dna seqeunce
		- example of a marker is a green fluorescent protien 
		- example of a marker is an antiobiotic resistant gene (if it is succsesefully ressiting a new thing)
