# Systems
- getting rid of metabolic waste is a reuqirment for all cells
- if it is a single cell, it can just directly output the waste via diffusion 
- multicellular organisms require a organ system to extrete the waste properly 
	- example, digesting a protien makes ammonia which is a poison 
	- ammonia is stored in the liver, which is combined with $CO_2$ which makes urea (which the body can tolerate in small amounts, which it then pees out)
	- urea is carried in the bloodstream from the liver -> kidneys, where it is filtered out and stored in bladder for future excretion 
- key componenets of the excretory system 
	- ureter, urinary bladder, urethra 
	- kidneys (filtering)
	- bladder (storage)
- excretory system takes blood and filters it, removing waste product and keeping fluids in a constant level (osmoregulation)
- 25% of the bodys blood is in the kidney at any given moment
- kideny parts (that we need to know) 
	- renal cortex (dark brown)
	- renal medulla (the outermost layer inside the cortex)
	- pyramid (segmants inside the kidney)
	- papilla 
	- renal artery and vien
	- nephrons are the filters of the kidney (around a million in the kidney) (the pipes)
- nephron
	- main part is the tube, which is wrapped with cappiliries that keeps supplying blood and reabsorbs the filtered blood 
	- things that get pushed out of the blood include:
		- $H_2O, \ K^+, \ NaCl, \ HCO_{3}, \ creatine, \ urea, \ glucose, \ amino acids$
	  - the following things are stuff that gets pushed o ut of the collecting duct, while threst return to the blood and stay in the collecting duct
		  - $H_2O, \ K^+, \ NaCl, \ HCO_{3}, \ urea, \ water, \ creatine$

what is identity ?

is it the things you enjoy? is it the people you talk to? is it the things you do? i think its none of those but the things you think. 

# Formation of urine (kidney)
- kidneys make urine in nephron 
- function of nephron 
	- production of urine, to get rid of water and waste 
	- blood enters in the afferent arteriole 
	- possesses through the glomerulus (a giant bundle of capillaries that push the blood at high pressure so it can be filtered)
	- bowman's capsule collects the blood 
	- the filtrate passes the tube and goes into the collecting duct 
	- produces 180 l / day of filtrate, but only 1 liter of urine per day 
	- most of the filtrate is reabsorbed 
	- efferent arteriole branches out into capillaries that surround the tubules 
	- secretion sometimes occur where the blood in the capillaries goes into the tubules
	- everything except for blood cells and protein go into the bowman's capsule 
	- proximal convoluted tubule is after the bowman's capsule 
	- 65% of sodium ions are reabsorbed 
	- wherever positive sodium ions go, Cl and other negative ions follow 
	- 65% of potassium and water is reabsorbed 
	- 90% of $HCO_3$
	- 100% of glucose and amino acids are reabsorbed into blood
	- 50% of urea is reabsorbed 
	- amino and medication is secreted into the tuble 
	- descending limb and ascending limb travel down and up to or from the medulla 
	- the ascending limb is impermeable to water, but very high impermeable to ions, opposite for descending 
	- water leaves while descending due to the medulla being so salty 
	- then when ascending the NaCl is pulled out 
	- 25% of NaCl is reabsorbed during this process 
	- distal convoluted tubule is the place where adjustments are made 
	- under the effects of a specific hormone, it controls what goes in and out 
	- area of filtration = glomerulus and bowman's capsule  (bowmans does not actually filter, it just collects)
	- reabsorption is the proximal convuluted tubule and the loop of henle (descending and ascending loop/limb/unclear)
	- most of the reabsorption in the proximal convulted tubule happens via active transport (atp required)
	- secretion area is the distal convulted tubule 
	- ADH controls how permiable the collecting duct is to water

# nervous system
- cephalization 
	- congreting all the main sense organs in one spot (aka the head in humans)
		- starfish have no cephalization 
		- lizards do 
	- often forms bilateral symmetry 
	- makes more complex systems 
- cerebellum started growing as evolution happend 
- folding patterns in the brain become more complex 
- nervous systems are better then hormone systems 
	- speed
	- cheaper to maintain 
	- more specific reactions to problems
- neurons are the functional cells of the nervous systems
	- supporting cells are called glia 
	- they pick up information to the spinal chord, or the brain and the spinal chord 
	- sending the information is called an affarent signal (sensory) 
	- sending the finromation from the brain to the msucle is called an efferent signal (or motor)
- Sensory Neurons carry impulses from inside and outside the body to the brain and psinal chord
	- afferent/sensory nuerons is interchangable
- interneurons are found within the brain and psinal chord and process incoming impulses and pass them on to the motor nuerons
- motor nuerons, carry impulses away frombrain and actually do things 
	- efferent/motor is interchangable
- the connection point between neurons is called axon terminals 
- sometimes signals go througha a reflex arc (rapid & involuntary) which skip the brain
- the nervous system is 
	- brain
	- spinal cord 
	- has the internerouns 
- peripheral nervous sytem is 
	- cranial nerves
	- spinal nervs
	- peripheral nerves
	- sensory nuerons
	- motor nuerons 



# Action stupid 

- we need to respond quickly and specifically, and hormones lowkey fucking suck at that (get good hormones) 
- reset quickly! reset quickly means winly!
- dendrite receives the impulse (the head spikes) and then it goes through the axon, then sends through the axon terminals (tail spikes)
- soduim, and pottatsuim are the movvment of charge and they signla like that 
- recall
	- nueron membrane 
	- the are a lot of postive ions outside the axon then inside 
	- lots of negative inside the axon 
	- the nueron is polarized 
	- the charge difference between the isnide and out the soude is $-70mV$ 

# Shitapses fuck you
- synapses are the spaces between two nuerons trying to get a message across 
- impulse has to jump the synapse 
- action potenitoal moves down and  axon, which releases nuerotransimtors, which docks with gates on the other side which leads to actioan potential to the other nueron 
- elecrtical enspe is just move the action potential down no problem (very fast) (no control) 
- chemical synapse are better ongod 
- presynaptic nueron and postsynaptic nueron is self explonatiry 
- the gap inbetween is called the synaptic cleft
- inside the presynaptic nueron there is presynaptic vesicles, which contain nuerotransmitters. there are also voltage-gated channels and docking protiens on the preseynpatic side 
- on the post snyecptic side there are recptors for the nuerotransimtters 
- the action potential opens that calcuim channels, which will dock with the nuerotransimmter vesicles, which will then take it to the docking protiens on the preseynaptic side 
- the vesicles dump it into the senaptic clef, which the recepters receive 
- acitaon potential is the threshold of -55 mV
