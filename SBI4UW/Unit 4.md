- getting rid of metabolic waste is a reuqirment for all cells
- if it is a single cell, it can just directly output the waste via diffusion 
- multicellular organisms require a organ system to extrete the waste properly 
	- example, digesting a protien makes ammonia which is a poison 
	- ammonia is stored in the liver, which is combined with $CO_2$ which makes urea (which the body can tolerate in small amounts, which it then pees out)
	- urea is carried in the bloodstream from the liver -> kidneys, where it is filtered out and stored in bladder for future excretion 
- key componenets of the excretory system 
	- ureter, urinary bladder, urethra 
	- kidneys (filtering)
	- bladder (storage)
- excretory system takes blood and filters it, removing waste product and keeping fluids in a constant level (osmoregulation)
- 25% of the bodys blood is in the kidney at any given moment
- kideny parts (that we need to know) 
	- renal cortex (dark brown)
	- renal medulla (the outermost layer inside the cortex)
	- pyramid (segmants inside the kidney)
	- papilla 
	- renal artery and vien
	- nephrons are the filters of the kidney (around a million in the kidney)
- nephron
	- main part is the tube, which is wrapped with cappiliries that keeps supplying blood and reabsorbs the filtered blood 
	- things that get pushed out of the blood include:
		- $H_2O, \ K^+, \ NaCl, \ HCO_{3}, \ creatine, \ urea, \ glucose, \ amino acids$
	  - the following things are stuff that gets pushed o ut of the collecting duct, while threst return to the blood and stay in the collecting duct
		  - $H_2O, \ K^+, \ NaCl, \ HCO_{3}, \ urea, \ water, \ creatine$

what is identity ?

is it the things you enjoy? is it the people you talk to? is it the things you do? i think its none of those but the things you think.
